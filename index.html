                    A skill set is a collection of skills and abilities. Each person has a different skill set depending
                    on their interests,
                    natural abilities, personal qualities and technical skills. Skills can expand your professional
                    competency and allow you
                    to perform your job well.

                    You can gain and improve skills with education and experience. The more advanced you are in
                    performing certain skills,
                    the more likely you are to get or progress in a job.
